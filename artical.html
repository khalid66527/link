            <section><p>Using articles (a, an, the) is one of the trickiest aspects of writing in English. This difficulty is not surprising, as different languages have different rules for article usage (assuming they even have articles), and the rules in English can seem confusing even to native English speakers! However, using articles correctly is one important way to make your writing sound natural. With this in mind, here are a few helpful guidelines that will help you decide when an article is needed (and which one to use) and also when one is not needed. See the flowchart at the end for a handy reference.</p></section>
            <h3>'The' versus 'A' / 'An'</h3>
            <section><p>A good rule of thumb to use is to ask whether the noun that is being modified is the only one of its kind or if it exists in more than one form/case. If it is the only one of its kind or you are referring to only one specific example, use 'the':</p></section>

            <section><p>The assay was conducted to identify the organism responsible for the outbreak. (This sentence refers to a specific assay, organism, and outbreak.)</p></section>
            <h3>Other times to use 'the' (and times NOT to use it)</h3>
            <section><p>f you are referring to a noun as a representative of every instance/individual (i.e., a general discussion), it can be appropriate to use 'the' with the singular form of the noun. 'The' is used primarily in scholarly writing when referring to machines, animals, and bodily organs.</p></section>
